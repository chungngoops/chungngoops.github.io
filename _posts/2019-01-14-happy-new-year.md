Happy new year.

It's the middle of January now,  quite late, but yeah Happy New Year everyone!
I've never shared my new year resolution publicly but this year let's do something different. And here is my the list:
* Make an app that uses Machine Learning.
* Become a member of one open source library.
* Read more than 25 books this year.
* Be able to play "Wake me up when September ends" by guitar.
* Run a half-marathon (21 km).
* Write at least 2 blog posts every month.

That enough, and I definitely will have a post at the end of 2019 to review all those items.

Cheers!
