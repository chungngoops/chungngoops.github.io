Hello world,

You guess what, I am starting a blog and to be honest I've never ever been good at writing and I am making it even harder by using English. So if you are looking for well-written posts in this blog, I guess you are at the wrong place. BUT I hope I will improve my writing time by time.

Things you might expect to be on here? The contents will pretty random but most of the posts will belong to the following topics:
* Programming talk.
* Food and drink ramblings.
* Whining.

That's all for the first post.
I will try to be consistent and let's see how far I can go.
Cheers!

**P/S:** My English is not good so please don't hesitate to tell me if I made any mistake.  
**A little fact:** It takes me 2 hours to write this post.
